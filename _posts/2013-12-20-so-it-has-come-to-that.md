They say that a man should do three things in his life: build a house, plant a 
tree and start blogging... At least this is what I think I probably might have
heard somewhere. Having such realiable information I finally decided to start
my own blog. 

Because nothing really that interesting happens in my private life (which is 
just a nicer way of saying "it's none of your business") this blog will be 
mainly about one of my hobbies which is programming, and which is also what
I currently do for a living (see the posts's date for an approximation of "currently").

I'm a Symfony developer so what you'll find here will be mostly web-related 
programming. Unless I find it boring and switch to C instead...
