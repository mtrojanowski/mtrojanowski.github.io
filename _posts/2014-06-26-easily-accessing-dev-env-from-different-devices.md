It can be painful to quickly show other people in your office what you are working
on or check your page on a mobile device. With the help of xip.io this task is
much easier. If you don't already know it you definitely should.

If you go to [xip.io](http://xip.io) you will find a quick intro on how to use the
tool. xip.io is a DNS service that will resolve addresses to your LAN's IP addresses.
So when you navigate to e.g. www.192.168.1.10.xip.io you will end up requesting
192.168.1.10. This gives you a quick and easy way to view your projects on different
devices connected to your LAN.

Happy testing!
